tags: baking, cupcakes

Ingredients:
- 2 large eggs (100 g)
- 160 g sour cream or full-fat yogurt
- 1.5 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 200 g cake flour (or bleached all-purpose flour)
- 200 g superfine sugar
- .5 tsp baking powder
- .5 tsp baking soda
- .5 tsp salt
- 170 g unsalted butter (softened)

Special Equipment: 
- 16 cupcake liners set in muffin pans or custard cups

Directions:
- Preheat the oven: 
	- Twenty minutes or more before baking, set an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350F
- Mix the liquid ingredients: 
	- In a small bowl, whist the eggs, 3 tablespoons of the sour cream, and the vanilla just until lightly combined
- Make the batter (1): 
	- In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt on low speed for 30 seconds. Add the butter and the remaining sour cream and mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened. Raise the speed to medium and beat for 1.5 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
	- Starting on medium-low speed, gradually add the egg mixture in two parts, beating on medium speed for 30 seconds after each addition to incorporate the ingredients and strengthen the structure. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Use a number 30 ice scream scoop or a spoon to place the batter (1.7 oz/50 g) into the prepared cupcake liners, smoothing the surfaces evenly with a small metal spatula. The liners will be about three-quarters full.
- Bake the cupcakes:
	- Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until dark golden brown, a wire cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, and the cupcakes spring back when pressed lightly in the centers.
- Cool the cupcakes:
	- Coll the cupcakes in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove them from the pans and set them on a wire rack. Cool completely.
